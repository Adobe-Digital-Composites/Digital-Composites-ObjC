Digital Composite Technology
=======

Welcome to the open source, Objective-C implementation of _Digital Composite Technology_.

Digital Composite Technology (DCX) is a framework for the creation of digital media in a mobile-first, cloud-connected world. DCX organizes creative works as a set of components. Component media types and relations are recorded in a well-known syntax, which furthers remix as part of the creative process. DCX also introduces network transfer algorithms that guarantee efficient, correct synchronization using standard cloud-scale storage services and web protocols. Taken together, these capabilities enable seamless creativity across mobile, desktop, and cloud.

This repository contains an open source (Apache License 2.0) implementation of DCX in Objective-C, suitable for use on both OS X and iOS. The implementation takes the form of a library, suitable for linking with your application. The repository also contains a sample iOS application that demonstrates its use.

This implementation of DCX demonstrates transferring digital composites to/from Dropbox. In order to successfully execute this code, you will need to obtain approval from Dropbox as would be required by any developer building any application that integrates with Dropbox services. You will also need to update DropboxAccount.m with your application's key and secret. See https://www.dropbox.com/developers for more information.

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
